# Design of a Simple Central Processing Unit

This project involves the design of a simple Central Processing Unit (CPU) using Quartus II 13.0 within a VHDL environment, to be implemented on an FPGA board.
The CPU simulates various fundamental components of a real-world processor, including standard input/output operations and memory functionality, achieved through the use of digital logic circuits and components.
The CPU architecture consists of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and a Control Unit, with the project incorporating three distinct ALU versions. 
Each performing a unique set of bitwise/logical operations, such as XOR, NAND, Shift/Rotation operations, etc., allowing for simple computational tasks to be done.
